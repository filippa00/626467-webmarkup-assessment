				<h4>Solar panels</h4>
					<p>What are solar panels? Solar panels are attached to the roof of your house,
					light from the sun is converted into electricity Solar panels collect photons
					from the sunlight and converts them into electrons of electricity. 
					From the solar panels the electricity flows into a Inverter that converts the
					electricity into useable electricity for the home. The amount of electricity
					depends on the intensity of the sun but even on cloudy days you still get
					electricity. This electricity can then be used to power the appliances 
					throughout your house.</p>

				<h4>Charge controller</h4>
					<p>Solar panels can provide much more voltage than that needed to charge a 
					battery. This is where a Charge controller comes in handy. The electric 
					current is handeld by the charge controller and will load the battery system. 
					This helps keep batteries from overcharging because it manages charging of 
					the battery bank. It also helps prevent the reduction of the battery life. 
					This means that the battery can last much longer.</p>
			</article>

				<h4>Battery system</h4>
					<p>By combining solar energy with the battery system the battery is able to 
					store electricity from the solar panels throughout the day. It can then be 
					used when there is not much sun or electricity from the solar panels. 
					There are different types of batteries such as flooded lead acid battery 
					which is affordable and have been around for more that 100 years.
					Absorbed glass mat (AGM) battery are still a lead acid battery because 
					they still have lead acid inside of it. Lithium ion batteries are relatively 
					new but very expensive. </p>

				<h4>DC power (direct current)</h4>
					<p>Solar panels receive photons from the sunlight to provide direct current. 
					Direct current is the flow of electricity always in a single direction from 
					positive to negative. Direct current is mostly used in low voltage appliances.
					The current created from solar panels and stored in batteries is always DC 
					current. Direct current however uses larger wires because it only travels in 
					a single direction and therefore also heats up more. Also most appliances 
					nowadays has alternating current therefore we need to convert from DC to AC.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="par5">
				<h4>Inverter</h4>
					<p>The inverter comes in handy when converting from DC to AC it converts the
					direct current from the solar panels  into AC a more useable better current
					flow for household appliances this what you find on wall outlet of  your house. 
					You can use a inverter for anything within your house from a laptop to a iron. 
					Inverters are usually easy to set up and maintenance is usually very easy. 
					There are different types of investors such as string inverters, power optimizers
					and microinverters. </p>
			</article>

				<h4>AC power (alternating current)</h4>
					<p>Alternating current does not flow in one direction like DC however it 
					flows in both directions. It changes direstion very fast and many times in a 
					second. Within solar energy to achieve alternating current an inverter is 
					#needed. This allows you to use the electricity received from the solar panels
					in your house. Unlike direct current however AC travels much further with high
					voltage and low current so its heat loss is minimized.</p>
